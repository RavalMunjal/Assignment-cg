      <h2>Mutual fund statistics</h2>

      <p>
        Mutual funds have become a major component of India's financial system. The mutual fund industry's
        assets under management (AUM) have grown significantly over the years.
        For example, the total AUM of the Indian mutual fund industry was reported in late years to be in
        the multiple tens of trillions of rupees. <sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Redemption and holding patterns are commonly discussed in regulatory and industry reports.
        A substantial portion of mutual fund units get redeemed within a short period after purchase,
        while only a small percentage of units remain invested for very long durations. <sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <h3>Mutual Fund Units Redeemed Data (example)</h3>
      <p>Holding period — units redeemed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>0-1 years: ~50-57%</li>
        <li>1-2 years: ~15-23%</li>
        <li>2-3 years: ~5-10%</li>
        <li>3-5 years: ~14-20%</li>
        <li>More than 5 years: ~2-3%</li>

      <h2>Mutual fund category breakup</h2>

      <p>
        The mutual fund industry in India is broadly categorized into equity funds, hybrid funds and debt funds.
        Example approximate AUM splits (for illustration) include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>AUM of Equity funds - large portion of total AUM.</li>
        <li>AUM of Hybrid funds - significant portion in blended/asset allocation funds.</li>
        <li>AUM of Debt funds - an important segment for fixed-income exposure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Specific numbers and dates are provided in regulatory and industry reports. <sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup></p>

      <h2>Controversies</h2>

      <p>
        The mutual fund industry has faced several controversies related to liquidity, credit exposures,
        and defaults by issuers of debt instruments. Events such as sudden scheme wind-ups, defaults of
        large borrowers and systemic liquidity shocks have affected investor confidence. <sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>

          <h4>2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco</h4>
          <p>
            In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India wound up six credit funds citing severe liquidity difficulties
            in the underlying instruments amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The move affected investors and drew regulatory scrutiny.
            The regulator later imposed restrictions and directed refunds for investors. <sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup>

          <h4>Reliance Mutual Fund</h4>

            Reliance Mutual Fund schemes experienced stress in their debt portfolios around 2019 due to exposure to certain troubled entities.

        <article id="ilfs">
          <h4>IL&FS crisis and impact</h4>
          <p>
            Defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) in 2018 caused mark-downs in funds holding those paper,
            producing liquidity concerns for some debt mutual funds and prompting regulatory responses. <sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup>

          <h4>Amtek Auto impact</h4>
          <p>
            Exposure to Amtek Auto and similar stressed issuers led several mutual funds to face mark-to-market losses and redemption pressure.
